This is an emulator for the DCPU16 CPU of Notch's new game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com).

Right now it runs in debug mode, options will be available later.

To try the emulator start the executable (./dcpu16 on linux).
Then you enter the program which will be put in RAM. Type -1 when you are done entering the RAM.
The emulator is now running and let's you step through the code.

Type 's' if you want to execute the next instruction, aka step.
Type 'r' if you want to know the content of the registers.
Type 'd' if you want to view the content of RAM, it let's you specify the start and end index.

That's it for now.
