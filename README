This is an emulator for the DCPU16 CPU of Notch's new game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com).
Project source code is at: https://github.com/tobbebia/dcpu16-emulator
Collaborators: tobbebia, skyfell

BUILDING:
Use 'make all'. Output file will be found in /bin.

RUNNING:
Terminal 'dcpu16 parameters ram_file'.

	PARAMETERS:
		-d	debug mode (let's you step through the instructions)
		-b	ram file is in binary format with little endian words
		-p	enable profiling

	EXAMPLES:
		dcpu16 -d -b notch_program.bin
		dcpu16 my_program.dat

When running in normal mode (not debug mode), the emulator will run forever until it encounters an infinite loop of the
following type:

USING THE EMULATOR AS AN EMULATOR CORE IN YOUR GUI PROJECT:
No real interface has been written yet, but we are working on it!
