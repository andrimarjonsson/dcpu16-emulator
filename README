This is an emulator for the DCPU16 CPU of Notch's new game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com).

Right now it runs in debug mode, more options might be available later.

To try the emulator:
1. Compile using 'make'.
2. Run the executable; ./dcpu16 RAMFILE where RAMFILE is a file to load hexadecimal integers from.
   RAMFILE can be skipped if you want to enter the program code in the terminal manually.

example:

./dcpu16 program_file


The emulator is now running (more instructions will be printed to the terminal by the executable).

That's it for now.
