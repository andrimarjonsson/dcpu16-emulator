/* This is the place to define some configurations. You can for example
   redirect all the printf calls to your own function.
   In the emulator core this file remains empty simply because it uses the
   default configuration. You can change this file if you create your own
   application which uses this emulator core. 

   Example of redirecting printf calls:
   #define PRINTF(fmt, ...) custom_printf_function(fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__)
